# rpi_reaction_game
Raspberry pi reaction game -  connect breadboard, button, led to test your reaction speed

This program should work in conjustion with the DYI -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJUkNJQBck

When you press the button on the 3rd light, that means you reaction was just right, and all the light will blink.  The game will continue but at a faster pace.  You can try this 5-10 times to get the LED to flash very fast and challenge another player to see if they can beat it by doing th next button press


Note, this py file was written in python 2, so you'll need to use the right python version to have it working.
